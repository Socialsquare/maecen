About the Maecen.net project
--------------------
Maecen.net is a true sharing-economy platform, allowing its users to create their own Maecenates and engage in the support of others.<br>
By supporting a Maecenate through a recurring monthly payment, you become a Maecen for that specific Maecenate and gain access to its exclusive content.<br>
Creating a Maecenate is free.<br>
The owner(s) of a Maecenate will chose the monthly price for new Maecens, and will receive the full amount except for 1DKK per Maecen per month, that will go to the `Maecen Project´ itself.<br>
If you pay (example) 20DKK per month, the 19DKK will go directly to the Maecenate.<br>
Maecen.net is 100% owned by DiGiDi a.m.b.a, a co-op owned in equal shares by more than 3.500 shareholders. Maecen.net in turn is Non Profit, and all income goes to operational costs and improvement/development of the Maecen Project. <br>

Terms and conditions
====================
Below you’ll find the terms that you accept when you support or create a Maecenate.<br> 
Should changes be made to those terms and conditions, you’ll be notified via email no later than one month before the implementation of those changes. Changes will not have any effect on your payments until you actively accept them.

When you support a Maecenate
====================
When you support a Maecenate, you become its Maecen. When you become a Maecen for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your credit card information to activate the payment.<br>
Recurring payment – Subscription agreement
----------------------------
By accepting the terms, you allow Maecen.net to automatically withdraw the recurring amount that you decided upon, from the account that you have linked to your user with your credit card information at your initial registration. Your support/payment for a specific Maecenate automatically continues on a month-to-month cycle, and will do so until you yourself cancel your support or the Maecenate is closed. <br>
A cycle begins on the day of your first payment. <br>
You will receive an email receipt every time a payment is made.
Change of support amount or subscription
---------------------------------------
You can, at any time log in to your profile on Maecen.net and change the amount by which you support a specific Maecenate, so long as it doesn’t fall below the minimum amount set by the creator(s) of the Maecenate. <br>
Should the creator(s) at any time chose to change the minimum amount, it will not affect your payment until you accept the update. 

Cancel your support here and now
----------------------------------
You can, at any time, cancel your support to any Maecenate without further notice, from which point there won’t be withdrawn any additional payments from your account. [You can do it here](/profile "Profile page")<br>
Payments that have already been processed will not be eligible for a refund. You will however, have access to the Maecenates exclusive page for the remainder of your subscription period.
Change of payment information
-------------------------------
If you for any reason wish to use a different credit card on Maecen.net, you can change its information on your [Profile](/profile "Profile page"). Notice that you can only have one card linked to your user at a time. If you want to use multiple cards for multiple Maecenates, you have to create a unique profile for each of the cards. <br>Your card information will not be recorded by Maecen.net
Personal information is YOUR information.
-------------------------------------------
The information you give to Maecen will not be shared, sold or in any way handed down to a 3rd party. <br>
Maecen will not use your information for internal analysis or datamining. So for instance you will not see any “Users who supported this project also supports…etc.” Maecen will utilize one cookie with its sole purpose of allowing you to remain logged in to your account on your device(s). <br>
The owner(s) of the Maecenate(s) that you support will have access to your contact information, so they can send you emails. No one will be able to see which Maecenates you support, or how much you support them with.   <br>
Maecen.net is compatible with the Tor browser. www.torproject.org/download/download
You are not allowed to share the exclusive content
----------------------------------------------------
When you support a Maecenate, you gain access to exclusive content. This content is for those who support the Maecenate only, and naturally you are not allowed to copy, share or in any way distribute the material, unless the content clearly states otherwise.

When you create a Maecenate
============================
By creating a Maecenate, you are eligible to receive recurring payments from those people, Maecens, who’ve chosen to support your cause.<br> 
Everyone, including individuals, organisations, companies and corporations can create a Maecenate.
It is free of charge to create a new Maecenate, but…
-------------------------------------------------------
You yourself decide upon the minimum amount that any new supporter should pay monthly, to become your Maecen. From this amount 1DKK including taxes is withdrawn for every active Maecen that supports your Maecenate. The rest will be deposited to you. 
Deposits will happen on your request, however no more than once per calendar month, into your bank- or PayPal account. Amounts below 300DKK will be deposited with a one-month delay.  <br>
Notice that all income from Maecen.net is eligible for taxation as it is regarded as subscription payments and not as donations.  
Only legal content for which you own the rights.
-------------------------------------------
As owner(s) of a Maecenate you can give your Maecens access to exclusive content in the shape of text, images, music and videos. When you upload material to Maecen.net you vouch for the legality of the content you use, including copyright for the music, pictures, video, texts etc. so no 3rd party is violated. <br>
Maecen.net cannot in any way be held accountable for any use of illegal material or material that is made available without the necessary rights in place, and reserves the right to, without further notice, close or suspend the access to any kind of material or account, should any dispute arise between you and a 3rd party.
