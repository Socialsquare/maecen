# About the Mæcen.net project

Mæcen.net is a platform for genuine sharing economy, that offers its users the possibility of creating their own Maecenates, and support others’ through monthly recurring payments.  <br>
[See prices and terms](https://maecen.net/terms)<br>
A Maecenate consists of a presentation page, visible to everyone, and a content page for texts, images and videos which are exclusively available to those who subscribe to the maecenate, thus becoming its’ Maecen. <br>

Countless creative people and corporations work specifically to create content for the internet. 
We are living, as creatives, in the illusion that we offer our content for free for the users of the internet, by posting that content free of charge, on the social media.   <br>
But once we as users receive that content, we indeed do pay – with our personal data. When you use something that is free online, you are no longer the customer – You are the product.  <br>
Platforms like Google/YouTube, Facebook and Twitter each are worth several billions of dollars. However, without the content provided by creative people on daily basis, these platforms would have no value at all.  <br>
The goal with Mæcen.net is to create an independent global platform based on joint ownership, where we actually pay for the content we receive. A place where we have the possibility of earning a recurring income by producing the content we want to create. No filters, No censorship. <br>

### Co-operative platform  
Mæcen.net is owned and run by the cooperative society DiGiDi a.m.b.a.
All of the more than 3.500 members own one share and one vote each. 
There are no investors, founders or other economic interests in the project. 
### Genuine sharing economy
Since there is no single person(s), corporations or investors who own the Mæcen.net project, we are thus promoting a genuine sharing economy. (Contrary to for instance AirBnB or Uber) All income is spent solely on running and improving the platform or to lower the administrative costs. 
It is the users of the platform who should earn the money, not the owners.  
### Ad Free
Mæcen.net will have no ads or commercials. It’s not possible to advertise on Mæcen.net. 
If you create a Maecenate, it’s up to you if you want to display ads or sponsorships on your content page. 
### Full protection of private data 
Maecen.net will not hand down, share or sell information on the users or user behaviour to a third-party. No kind of analysis will be generated on the count of the information you deliver about yourself or your behaviour on Mæcen.net 
This means that you won’t receive information like ´Users who support this Maecenate also supports this once´ and so on… Like you also cannot see how many or which users are supporting a specific Maecenate. 
### Open Source
Maecen is built upon an open source platform. If you wish to be connected to the development-team, and help to further improve Mæcen.net, you are more than welcome to contact maecen@digidi.dk 
### Free Flow
Free Flow is the principle to reduce the amount of joints between distributor and buyer. Examples could be middlemen or instances which exercise a form of filtering or censorship. When you support a Maecenate your payment will go directly to the person who created the Maecenate. The Mæcen.net project claims a fixed payment per Maecen, per month. 
As of now, that amount is 1 kroner (0.13€) but as the number of people who use Maecen increases, the lower this amount in turn can become, as the goal of Mæcen.net is to exactly pay out as much as possible to the creators of its content. 
### Free Speech – Freedom of speech 
On Mæcen.net there will be no filtering or censorship, as long as the content lives up to Danish legislations, which is one of the most open of its kind when it comes to freedom of speech. Also, by paying directly to the ones who write the content, it’s possible to avoid the kind of censorship or filtering that is common occurrence in the media.  
In such case for example, the content could be filtered to either fit into a certain editorial frame, or to please sponsors, advertisers or other economic interests. By funnelling money directly to the creator – be it a journalist or a band, you can be certain that those you support will continue to enjoy the freedom to express themselves however they want too.
